        <h2>We run Rivers to relax.</h2>
        <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.
            <br> Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p> <img src="images/relaxingriver.jpg" alt="River trip relaxation"> </section>

        <h2>We run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
        <p class="middle-row-text">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue.
            <br> of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
